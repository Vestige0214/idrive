## Startup Weekend UBC March 2013 Project

Android app that provides incentives for people to become designated drivers when heading out to drink with their
friends. 


## How it works

The user creates a party and other people can choose to join his or her party via a code. Once everyone joins, tthe participants of the party can choose to volunteer, randomly select, or play a game to select who is the designated driver. Once the designated driver is selected, he/she will be able to redeem a special offer (eg. a free non-alcoholic drink, discount on wings, VIP passes for them or their friends so they can skip the line at a nightclub) from establishments that are willing to partner with us.
